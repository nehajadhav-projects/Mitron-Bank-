## Project Overview
Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, aims to expand its product portfolio by launching a new line of credit cards. To test the feasibility of this initiative, they provided a sample dataset of 4,000 customers from five cities. AtliQ Data Services, tasked with analyzing this data, assigned Peter Pandey to derive actionable insights to guide Mitron Bankâ€™s strategy and secure the full-scale implementation of the project. This pilot study will help tailor the credit cards to the target audience based on their spending patterns, income levels, and customer segmentation.
